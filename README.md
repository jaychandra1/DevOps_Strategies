Deployment strategies are methods used to implement changes to an application or system while reducing downtime and risk. There are various deployment strategies, each with its own benefits and use cases. 
Most popular strategies: Blue-Green Deployment, Canary Deployment, and Rolling Updates.
## Blue-Green Deployment
Blue-Green Deployment involves running two identical environments — one is the “Blue” (currently live) version, and the other is the “Green” (new) version. The transition from the Blue to Green environment is done in one swift move, reducing downtime significantly. If any issues arise during the deployment, you can quickly roll back to the stable Blue environment.

## Canary Deployment
Canary Deployment is a phased rollout strategy where a new version is released to a subset of users or servers before being made available to everyone. This approach allows early detection of potential issues and mitigates risks by limiting the blast radius of the deployment.

## Rolling Updates
Rolling Updates involve gradually replacing instances of the old version with instances of the new version. This strategy ensures that a portion of your application is always running during the deployment process, minimizing downtime.
